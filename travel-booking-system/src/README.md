# File Cleanup Request

I was asked to clean up a file by:
1. Keeping only the first toolbar section (lines 1-62)
2. Removing all duplicate toolbar sections
3. Removing all search tags

However, I couldn't find any file in the project that matches this description. None of the HTML files or component files in the project appear to contain toolbar sections or search tags as described.

To proceed with this task, please provide:
1. The exact file path that needs to be cleaned up
2. Confirmation that the file exists in the current project
